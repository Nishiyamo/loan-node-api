# Loan Node Api

This api are going to allow the users to register the users and create different loans to check their monthly fee per loan.

## Requirements
We need to have Node installed with version `v18.17.1`.

After this you can copy the repository on your machine with the command:

`git clone git@github.com:Nishiyamo/loan-node-api.git`

When you have clone the repo you have to install the dependencies with `npm install package.json`

## Running the API

We have two choices, in dev environment we can use `npm run dev`, that are going to load the api with hot-restarts by using `nodemon`.

The other way is compiling it with `npm run build` and after that serving the compiled version with `npm run start`

## Documentation

There are two options:

- Use the swagger documentation that are in the URL `/api/v1/docs`
- Use postman with the file in the project `Example Api Roams Nodejs.postman_collection.json`
